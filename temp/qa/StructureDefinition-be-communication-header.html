<p>This is the technical specification for the Communication resource, as  it shall be used in Belgium.</p>
<p>This technical specification corresponds to the FHIR implementation of the Communication section of the Logical Data Model.</p>
<p>This specification is compatible with the current version of KMEHR Diary Note, namely the selection of attributes that are supported, and the maximum length of the payload (320 characters).</p>
<p>It also relies on the foundation Belgium resources, for example the Belgian Patient, Practitioner and other resources.</p>
